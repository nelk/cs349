Crane Simulator
by Alex Klen

Instructions on how to use the simulator (can be found in the application as well):
- Use the mouse to click and drag the crane and its arms.
- Position the crane magnet parallel and close to a candy block and click on the magnet to pick it up.
- Move the block to a desired location and align it parallel and close to the surface, then click on the magnet to drop it.
- If the block falls too far or the angle is not close to parallel, it will break and be reset in the simulator.
- Try to create the structure outlined with the blocks provided.
- Select the 'Grade' option under the 'Game' menu to have your work evaluated.


Enhancements:
- Gamification of simulator - need to construct a house-like structure efficiently in order to receive a good grade.
- Some physics for falling blocks and collisions.
- Invalid moves in the simulator cause the crane to be highlighted red; the move is reset if you let go of the mouse when the crane is in an invalid state.
