QuickMotion - Alex Klen

To run the desktop application, cd to the desktop directory and run 'make'.
To run the android application, open the eclipse project located in QuickMotion and build and run it.
The reason there are copies of 'shared' and 'android' in the QuickMotion directory is because I was developing in IntelliJ IDEA, and I copied the directories into an Eclipse project to fullfill the specs of the assignment (having an Eclipse project for the Android component).

Please view the README.txt files in the desktop and android directories for details about each application.
